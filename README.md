Eagle-Eye-AI
AI powered real time crime detection.

Problem Statement
According to the FBI's Crime Clock statistics, a violent crime occurred every 26.3 seconds in the United States, equating to approximately 137 violent crimes per hour. In urgent criminal situations such as kidnappings, robberies, or assaults, law enforcement agencies often receive suspect descriptions that include visual details like gender, clothing, accessories, or behavior. Manually scanning hours of surveillance footage to locate suspects is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. To address this challenge, there is a need for an intelligent system capable of analyzing real-time surveillance data, extracting relevant visual information, and automatically notifying the law enforcement or first responders. By integrating AI-powered visual understanding with real-time monitoring, this solution provides law enforcement agencies with a proactive tool for automated suspect detection and first responders to react quickly, enhancing public safety, operational efficiency, and investigative accuracy. There is no current tool that connects surveillance footage with real-time alerts or understands what's happening visually, and intelligently flags it for response.

Proposed Solution
Eagle Eye AI is a real-time surveillance intelligence system that detects, understands, and notifies threats from video instantly. The system bridges the gap between law enforcement and live camera feeds, transforming passive video into actionable insight for first responders and law enforcement.

Eagle Eye AI works by identifying people, analyzing interactions, and summarizing what’s happening in the scene in human language, which makes our system uniquely powerful its built-in keyword-based threat filtering, which scans every generated summary for crime-relevant terms to prioritize high-risk frames and alert authorities immediately.

Real-World Scenario Example
“A female pedestrian, described as an adult wearing a pink saree, was walking alone when an unidentified male suspect approached her from behind and forcefully snatched a gold chain from her neck.” YOLOv8 detects both individuals and tracks their movement. The relevant frame is passed to OpenAI Vision, which generates: “A man is seen approaching a woman in pink attire and appears to snatch something from her neck.” Our keyword engine detects the term “snatch,” flagging the frame and generating an immediate alert with timestamp and visual reference, enabling responders to act without delay.

Implementation & Workflow
Datasets: 15 CCTV videos simulating different public safety scenarios (e.g., theft, assault, loitering). Frame Capture: Adaptive strategy — default interval every 0.25 seconds, configurable per alert context. Allows focus on critical video segments with optimized frame density. YOLOv8 + OpenAI Vision: YOLO detects individuals and their actions; OpenAI Vision summarizes the scene. Keyword Filtering: Summaries are filtered using crime-specific keywords; parallel logic also checks for alert description matches.

Results & Performance
Visual Outputs: Frames with bounding boxes, keyword-tagged summaries, AI-generated descriptions. Examples: “A person conceals an object in waistband,” “Two individuals struggle,” “A person flees after grabbing an item.”

Metrics:
15 video datasets processed
Detection and flagging latency: 3–5 seconds
Keyword precision: 90%+
Human workload reduction: ~80%
Broader Impact & Contribution to Public Safety
Eagle Eye AI doesn’t just enhance surveillance — it transforms how first responders engage with critical visual data. By eliminating manual review and presenting meaningful, context-rich summaries, our system reduces response time and cognitive burden during emergencies. It is highly adaptable for deployment in campuses, transport hubs, or city surveillance networks.

Law enforcement benefits from instant situational awareness and faster suspect identification. Eagle Eye AI acts as an intelligent assistant — enhancing human capability, not replacing it — and operates with tireless precision. We believe this system is a leap forward in using AI for social good by delivering real-time, actionable intelligence directly into the hands of those who protect our communities.

Final Statement
Eagle Eye AI transforms traditional surveillance by turning silent video into actionable intelligence — empowering first responders to act faster, smarter, and safer. It's not just an improvement; it's the new standard in campus and public safety.
